Projects.tsx shows 'Lead Technical Designer' for the Residency project and 'Technical Designer' for the Virtual Reality Trainings project. Resume.tsx shows 'Lead Technical Designer (Systems, Features, UI)' for The Residency entry and 'Technical Designer (Features)' for the Realworldone entry. The additional modifications to useInternetIdentity.ts and frontend-file-summaries.txt are unrelated to the build request. The project_state.json addition is a tracking file, not a frontend feature.",
